# Tableau JavaScript API & Type declaration

[中文版本](README_zh.md)

Tableau provide an official JS API to embed dashboard into webpage [link](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/js_api/en-us/JavaScriptAPI/js_api.htm). But the only way to use it is add external reference. The type support for TypeScript wasn't provided as well.

````html
<script src="https://YOUR-SERVER/javascripts/api/tableau-2.min.js"></script>
````

This project was modified base on Tableau official api. Type support was included.
